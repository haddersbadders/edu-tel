This site you're reading right now was originally a WordPress site. I had to give up the hosting of the WordPress site and find an alternative.

## The problem with WordPress

Well, there's not really a problem with WordPress, it's a perfectly good platform - albeit a little bloated and faffy!

Another issue, especially within a cyber-security conscious University hosting, are the vulnerabilities of hosting a dynamic website that uses php scripts and a MySQL database.  While WordPress is definitely a lot better security-wise, I do remember the days of constant bot bombardment and spam commenting, not to mention the occasional site hack!

Database-driven sites can be a little slow due to the database being queried in order to load the content.

While it's nice to have a content *management* system, it's not a great deal breaker.

## Other solutions
While discussing closing down hosting, it was suggested to use Google Sites. While Google Sites is actually quite a good platform for non-web developers, it's not really the solution I - as a seasoned developer - was looking for.

## Static website builders
I've been toying with static website builders for a while now. I first cut my teeth learning to build static websites in Dreamweaver, then coding HTML and CSS pages, far too many years ago!

Then a few years ago, I stumbled on *static website generators*.
