slug: As part of the WondaVR pilot in 2022, Dr. Becky Parry and I wanted to explore using WondaVR to create a virtual exhibition space for students on the EDU61004 Media Making and Creativity module (within the MA in Digital Literacies, Culture and Education).

WondaVR is the University of Sheffield's 360째 media and VR hosting platform. Primarily, WondaVR allows you to create immersive virtual reality experiences using a combination of 360째 images and video and augment these with audio, text, image and video annotations. 

360째 images and videos can be easily captured using a 360 camera and immersive experiences can be easily put together in the simple-to-use WondaVR platform, right within your web browser. You can [read more about 360 media and the WondaVR platform on the Digital Learning web pages](https://students.sheffield.ac.uk/digital-learning/360). 

As well as the 360째 image and video modes, WondaVR can also be used to create 3D virtual environments where the user can move around a space and interact with objects within that space. This is extended further by a multi-user mode where multiple people can visit a virtual space and interact with each other via text chat and voice. 

## An Open Room

You may want to use this as you would a physical room and invite students to meet you at different times.

But because the room is open there's nothing to stop other students from entering the room at the wrong time and interrupting your meeting.

## Lock the Room

Staff members have the ability to lock and unlock the Course Room at any time to prevent students from entering.

If you want to have a fully private online meeting with a student, you simply need to:

1. both enter the Course Room while it is unlocked
2. once inside, lock the Course Room (thus preventing others from entering)
3. once the meeting has ended you can unlock the Course Room to allow other students in

The option to lock/unlock the room is located in the Course Room's options menu:

Because the Course Room is running in a separate tab to Blackboard, you can lock/unlock the course room while inside the room by just switching to the Blackboard tab and then back again.
