WondaVR is the University of Sheffield's 360° media and VR hosting platform. Primarily, WondaVR allows you to create immersive virtual reality experiences using a combination of 360° images and video and augment these with audio, text, image and video annotations. 

360° images and videos can be easily captured using a 360 camera and immersive experiences be easily authored in the simple-to-use WondaVR platform, right within your web browser. You can [read more about 360 media and the WondaVR platform on the Digital Learning web pages](https://students.sheffield.ac.uk/digital-learning/360). 

As well as the 360° image and video modes, WondaVR can also be used to create 3D virtual environments where the user can move around a space and interact with objects within that space. This is extended further by a multi-user mode where multiple people can visit a virtual space and interact with each other via text chat and voice - much like a virtual meeting space. 

# Building a virtual exhibition
As part of the WondaVR pilot in 2022, I wanted to explore using WondaVR to create a virtual exhibition space for students on the EDU61004 Media Making and Creativity module (within the [MA in Digital Literacies, Culture and Education](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/postgraduate/taught/courses/2023/digital-literacies-culture-and-education-ma)).

In this module, students explore the different ways children can use technology to be creative in the classroom. Each week students explore a different technology and create something with it - examples are videos, stop-frame animation, avatars, posters etc.

I wanted a way that students could showcase their work and at the same time learn about authoring VR experiences themselves. 

I wanted this to be a collaborative project where students would co-create the exhibition, but were restricted by the platform only allowing one person to edit at a time.  Instead we devised a collaborative session where students could collate all their media files (using Google Spaces) and discuss where things should go within the space. Students took it in turn to have a go at editing. 

You can [explore the virtual exhibition here](https://wvr.li/5jm370).

As you can see, it worked really well! 

You can move around the exhibition using the WASD keys to go forward-left-back-right respectively. There are a variety of media in the exhibition - images, text, videos and even a 3D model of a Pikachu!

# First reflections and improvements
One aspect I wanted to improve on was the capability for students to collaborate right within WondaVR - something that didn't seem possible given the main editing interface of WondaVR doesn't allow this. It was suggested that I try letting students use the exhibition space as end-users but with multi-user mode enabled. This would allow students to treat the space as a "virtual meeting space" and add and arrange media within it, together.  I tried this in a recent session with a new cohort of students and discovered a few caveats:

- media can't be uploaded. Media needs to be pre-uploaded in editing mode beforehand, then students are able to add and move media around
- Media can be moved around the space, but can't be "snapped" to the wall - this is a feature of edit mode 
- Text annotations can't be added in multi-user mode, only full edit mode

Technically, this allowed collaboration, but seemed a bit chaotic - students were together in a room trying to collaborate using a platform that was new to them. Had they been remote, it may have worked well. Did we really need the platform to be collaborative when they were all in a room together? Also the caveats above proved a bit stifling to the workflow (added to this was the requirement to upload media to Kaltura first, rather than directly to WondaVR).

# Further reflections and improvements
At the moment, WondaVR isn't a collaborative authoring environment in itself. This isn't to say that we can't collaborate on a WondaVR project, but the collaborative part can be done elsewhere e.g. on paper, whiteboard, Miro boards etc. Collaboration is about working together,discussing, planning something, and if we need to use technology to help with this, there are plenty of tools available. 

It's ok that WondaVR isn't truly collaborative! What matters is that it is a really easy-to-use platform that both educators and students can use to create interesting and immersive experiences that can truly enhance both teaching and learning.
