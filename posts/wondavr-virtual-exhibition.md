WondaVR is the University of Sheffield's 360째 media and VR hosting platform. Primarily, WondaVR allows you to create immersive virtual reality experiences using a combination of 360째 images and video and augment these with audio, text, image and video annotations. 

360째 images and videos can be easily captured using a 360 camera and immersive experiences can be easily put together in the simple-to-use WondaVR platform, right within your web browser. You can [read more about 360 media and the WondaVR platform on the Digital Learning web pages](https://students.sheffield.ac.uk/digital-learning/360). 

As well as the 360째 image and video modes, WondaVR can also be used to create 3D virtual environments where the user can move around a space and interact with objects within that space. This is extended further by a multi-user mode where multiple people can visit a virtual space and interact with each other via text chat and voice. 

# Building a virtual exhibition
As part of the WondaVR pilot in 2022, Dr. Becky Parry and I wanted to explore using WondaVR to create a virtual exhibition space for students on the EDU61004 Media Making and Creativity module (within the [MA in Digital Literacies, Culture and Education](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/postgraduate/taught/courses/2023/digital-literacies-culture-and-education-ma)).

In this module, students explore the different ways children can use technology to be creative in the classroom. Each week students explore a different technology and create something with it - examples are videos, stop-frame animation, avatars, posters etc.

We wanted a way that students could showcase their work and at the same time learn about authoring VR experiences themselves. 

We wanted this to be a collaborative project where students would co-create the exhibition, but were restricted by the platform only allowing one person to edit at a time.  Instead we devised a collaborative session where students could collate all their media files (using Google Spaces) and discuss where things should go within the space. Students took it in turn to have a go at editing. 

You can [explore the virtual exhibition here](https://wvr.li/5jm370).

You can move around the exhibition using the WASD keys to go forward-left-back-right respectively. There are a variety of media in the exhibition - images, text, videos and even a 3D model of a Pikachu!
