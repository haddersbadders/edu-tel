<p>In the School of Education, we've started to explore the use of Virtual Reality (VR) in teaching and learning.</p><p>In 2019 we received a grant from the University of Sheffield Alumni Fund to purchase some VR headsets and 360° video cameras and this post shows you some of the things we've done so far and some other interesting examples.</p><p>The School of Education would like to acknowledge the generosity of alumni, staff and friends of the University who have given support through contributions to the University’s Alumni Fund.</p><p>An Alumni Fund Departmental grant given in 2019 has helped with the funding of this project.</p><h2 id="the-equipment">The Equipment</h2><p>With the Alumni Fund grant we purchased the following equipment:</p><p><a href="https://www.oculus.com/quest/">Oculus Quest headsets</a> - we purchased 10 of these which can be used in classes so students can experience immersive VR.</p><p><a href="https://www.insta360.com/product/insta360-onex">Insta360 One X cameras</a> - we purchased two of these along with tripods. These are for recording 360° videos and taking 360° photos.</p><p><a href="https://zoomcorp.com/en/us/handheld-recorders/handheld-recorders/h3-vr-360-audio-recorder/">Zoom H3VR audio recorder</a> - we purchased one of these surround audio recorders.</p><h2 id="testing-the-cameras">Testing the Cameras</h2><p>I took the opportunity to pop down to a nearby park to test out the video quality of the cameras.</p><p>The following video was recorded in Weston park, Sheffield; edited with Adobe Premiere and uploaded to YouTube.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/-QunMfjhA1s">360 immersive video of the duck pond in Weston Park, Sheffield</a></p><p><em>To view the video on the Oculus Quest or other headset: open the Youtube VR app and search for &quot;Weston Park Duck Pond&quot;.</em></p><p>I also took several still images on that day around the park and in the Arts Tower and put them together using the <a href="https://roundme.com/">https://roundme.com/</a> app.</p><p><a href="https://roundme.com/tour/78004/view/1680897">Short Tour of Sheffield in Round.me</a></p><p>The Chemistry Department have also used <a href="http://Round.me">Round.me</a> and produced a virtual <a href="https://roundme.com/tour/161253/view/408128">Chemistry labs tour</a> for their students.</p><h2 id="exploring-vr-for-teaching-and-learning">Exploring VR for Teaching and Learning</h2><figure><p><img src="/images/Broomhall_tinyplanet-1024x507.jpg" alt="A &quot;Tiny Planet&quot; image of Broomhall School"></p><figcaption>A "Tiny Planet" image of Broomhall School</figcaption></figure><p>We are working on projects at the moment, but the first completed project was in collaboration with <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/education/people/academic/liz-chesworth">Dr. Liz Chesworth</a>, Lecturer in Early Childhood Education and Broomhall Nursery School &amp; Children's Centre in Sheffield.</p><p>For this project, I took a series of &quot;Child's-eye-view&quot; pictures of the inside one of the classrooms at Broomhall School. The images showed how an early-years classroom could be setup for learning using a variety of activities. Many thanks to Bethany, a teacher at Broomhall, for setting up the classroom so well!</p><p>I then created a virtual tour of the classroom using Google Poly's Tour Creator (this has now closed down!). Liz and I added scene descriptions and hot-spots at points-of-interest with questions to prompt students viewing the tour to think about how and why the room layout had been designed that way.</p><p>You can view the tour, re-made on Roundme, here:</p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://roundme.com/embed/527230/1797188" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
